First, run the file "logisoft_hackathon_rl_optimizer.py" and ensure that you have python installed to do so and all the libraries with "pip install -r requirements.txt", then a model called "vehicle_placement_model.pth" will be created in the directory. It will be used in the streamlit application.
Run the streamlit application using 'streamlit run app.py', for the interactive demo use the sidebar to control the environment around the agent. Thank you for reviewing my work!
